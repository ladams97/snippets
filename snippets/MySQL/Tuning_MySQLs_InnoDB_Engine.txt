# First, you need to decide how much RAM to dedicate to MySQL. On a server
# running Apache, PHP, and MySQL you should dedicate roughly 25% of the server's
# total RAM. On a server just running MySQL you should dedicate roughly 75% of
# the server's total RAM. This will be referred to as DMR (dedicated MySQL RAM).

# Second, you need to estimate whether MySQL's workload will be small, medium,
# large, or extra large. This is extremely hard to do accurately and can only be
# guessed based on past experience. This will be referred to as MWS (MySQL
# workload size) going forward.

# Then set:

# innodb_buffer_pool_size to DMR
# tmp_table_size to 64M, 128M, 256M, or 512M based on MWS
# max_heap_table_size to tmp_table_size
# innodb_log_buffer_size to 8M, 16M, 32M, or 64M based on MWS
# innodb_log_file_size to 128M, 256M, 512M, or 1G based on MWS

sudo vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf

[mysqld]
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G
tmp_table_size = 64M
max_heap_table_size = 64M
innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M
innodb_log_file_size = 128M

# It's unlikely these will be different, but ensure that the following are
# set:

# innodb_file_per_table = 1
# skip_name_resolve = 1
