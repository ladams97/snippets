# First, you need to decide how much RAM to dedicate to MySQL. On a server
# running Apache, PHP, and MySQL you should dedicate roughly 25% of the server's
# total RAM. On a server just running MySQL you should dedicate roughly 75% of
# the server's total RAM. This will be referred to as DMR (dedicated MySQL RAM).

sudo vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf

# Then set:

# innodb_buffer_pool_size to DMR

[mysqld]
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G
