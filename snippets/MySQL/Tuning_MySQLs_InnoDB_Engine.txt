# First, you need to decide how much RAM to dedicate to MySQL. On a server
# running Apache, PHP, and MySQL you should dedicate roughly 25% of the server's
# total RAM. On a server just running MySQL you should dedicate roughly 75% of
# the server's total RAM.

# Then set innodb_buffer_pool_size to that value and restart MySQL.

sudo vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf

[mysqld]
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G
