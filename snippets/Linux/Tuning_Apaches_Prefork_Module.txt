# First, you need to decide how much RAM to dedicate to Apache. On a server
# running Apache, PHP, and MySQL you should dedicate roughly 25% of the server's
# total RAM. On a server just running Apache you should dedicate roughly 75% of
# the server's total RAM. This will be referred to as DAR (dedicated Apache
# RAM).

# Second, you need to calculate on average how much RAM each Apache process
# uses. This will be referred to as AAPRU (average Apache process RAM usage)
# going forward.

# The following command will show all the current Apache processes and how much
# RAM they're using. From this you can then estimate the average RAM usage.

ps aux | grep "apache2" | awk "{print \$6}"

# Then set:

# MaxRequestWorkers to DAR / AAPRU
# ServerLimit to MaxRequestWorkers
# StartServers to MaxRequestWorkers / 4
# MinSpareServers to StartServers
# MaxSpareServers: MaxRequestWorkers / 2
# MaxConnectionsPerChild to 1000

<IfModule mpm_prefork_module>
	MaxRequestWorkers 32
	ServerLimit 32
	StartServers 8
	MinSpareServers 8
	MaxSpareServers 16
	MaxConnectionsPerChild 1000
